# Deep Learning Projects
This repo contains some of my work as a machine learning engineer. Over the past three years I've been involved in diverse Deep Learning projects using different architectures, and I'm excited to learn about the different applications of AI in the engineering world.
- Under the Dense_networks folder you can find an exciting project where I prediced fuel properties based on the chemical structures and thermodynamic conditions of fuels. The challenge was to design useful feature arrays for the model to learn from, as the thermodynamic state of the fuels required special feature segmentation to avoid information leakage from data in the validation set to the training set.
-  In the RNNs folder I analized wind behavior with LSTM networks for my TechLabs project. This data had many features which where difficult to sort out in order to create a meaningful model.
-  The CNNs folder implements a U-Net model for segmenting blood vessels from human kidneys. I'm currently working on this project, where the main challenge lies in iterating over the possible ImageDataGenerator features and its trade-off with computational demand.
