# **Deep Learning Projects**
Welcome to my repository, where I document my journey as a **Machine Learning Engineer** exploring the diverse applications of **Deep Learning** in engineering and science. Originally "only" a mechanical engineer, I've adapted to the modern world necessities of what it means to be a mechanical engineer. The flexibility & knowledge gained during university, backed by my working experience, has taught me how to **identify**, **adapt**, and **learn** possible applications of ML in the vast world of engineering.

Over the past five years, Iâ€™ve worked on various projects utilizing different architectures, models & constantly learning and refining my approach to real-world AI challenges.  

Let's get in touch on LinkedIn! https://www.linkedin.com/in/bruno-copa-a034311b4/

## **Project Overview**
### **1. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) - Fuel Property Prediction**
ðŸ“‚ **Location:** `Dense_networks/`  
This was my first deep learning project, where I **predicted fuel properties** based on their **chemical structure** and **thermodynamic conditions**. The main challenge was **feature engineering**, particularly segmenting thermodynamic states effectively to **prevent information leakage** from training to validation sets.  

### **2. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) - Medical Image Segmentation**
ðŸ“‚ **Location:** `CNNs/`  
This project focuses on using a **U-Net architecture** to **segment blood vessels in human kidneys**. The key difficulty lies in tuning **ImageDataGenerator** parameters while balancing **computational efficiency**. The main learnings were **data augmentation strategies** to enhance performance.  

### **3. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) - Catalyst Adsorption Energy Prediction**
ðŸ“‚ **Location:** `GNNs/`  
In this project, I leverage **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** to accelerate **catalyst material screening** for **fuel cell development**. The goal is to predict **adsorption energies of adsorbates on catalyst surfaces**, helping researchers construct **volcano plots** to identify optimal compositions for the **oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)**.  
- The model is trained using **quantum chemistry data**. Evaluation and inference rely on **MLflow**.  
- A **FastAPI backend** allows real-time predictions.  
- A **Streamlit web app** provides an interactive interface for researchers to easily input catalyst compositions and visualize results, including **parity plots**.

### **4. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) - Wind Behavior Analysis**
ðŸ“‚ **Location:** `RNNs/`  
As part of my **TechLabs project**, I implemented **LSTM networks** to analyze **wind behavior**. The dataset contained numerous features, making **feature selection and preprocessing** a significant challenge in building a meaningful model.  

### **5. Keras Deep Dive**
ðŸ“‚ **Location:** `keras_deep_dive/`  
More than a project here I started, as the name of the folder says, to "deep dive" more into the Kras API after having read FranÃ§ois Chollet's "Deep Learning with Python". The code and ideas there do not belong to me and full credit goes to the Keras API inventor :)
