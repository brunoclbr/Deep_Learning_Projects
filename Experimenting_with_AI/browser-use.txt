Browser Use is an open-source framework designed to make websites accessible to AI agents by providing a powerful yet simple interface for browser automation. It enables AI agents to interact with web browsers, allowing them to perform tasks such as web scraping, form submissions, and data extraction.

**Key Features:**

- **Vision and HTML Extraction:** Combines visual understanding with HTML structure extraction for comprehensive web interaction.
- **Multi-Tab Management:** Automatically handles multiple browser tabs for complex workflows and parallel processing.
- **Element Tracking:** Extracts clicked elements' XPaths and repeats exact actions for consistent automation.
- **Custom Actions:** Allows the addition of custom actions like saving to files, database operations, notifications, or human input handling.
- **Self-Correcting:** Intelligent error handling and automatic recovery for robust automation workflows.
- **LLM Support:** Compatible with all LangChain Large Language Models (LLMs), including GPT-4, Claude 3, and Llama 2.

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Installation:**
   - Install the `browser-use` package using pip:
     ```bash
     pip install browser-use
     ```
   - Optionally, install Playwright for browser automation:
     ```bash
     playwright install
     ```

2. **Set Up API Keys:**
   - Add your API keys to a `.env` file in your project directory:
     ```
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
     ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key
     ```

3. **Create an AI Agent:**
   - Use the following Python script to create and run an AI agent:
     ```python
     from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
     from browser_use import Agent
     import asyncio

     async def main():
         agent = Agent(
             task="Find a one-way flight from Bali to Oman on 12 January 2025 on Google Flights. Return me the cheapest option.",
             llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o"),
         )
         result = await agent.run()
         print(result)

     if __name__ == "__main__":
         asyncio.run(main())
     ```
   - Replace the `task` parameter with your desired task description.

4. **Register Custom Actions (Optional):**
   - Define custom actions to extend the agent's capabilities:
     ```python
     from browser_use.controller.service import Controller

     controller = Controller()

     @controller.action('Ask user for information')
     def ask_human(question: str, display_question: bool) -> str:
         return input(f'\n{question}\nInput: ')
     ```
   - Integrate the controller with your agent:
     ```python
     agent = Agent(task=task, llm=model, controller=controller)
     await agent.run()
     ```
