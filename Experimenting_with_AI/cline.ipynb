    "Sure! Here's a summary/roadmap on how to use Cline on VS Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Install VS Code**: Download and install Visual Studio Code from the official website.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Install Cline Extension**:\n",
    "    - Open VS Code.\n",
    "    - Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window.\n",
    "    - Search for \"Cline\" and install the extension.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Configure Cline**:\n",
    "    - Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P on macOS).\n",
    "    - Type \"Cline: Configure\" and select it.\n",
    "    - Follow the prompts to configure Cline according to your preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Using Cline**:\n",
    "    - Open a terminal in VS Code.\n",
    "    - Use Cline commands directly in the terminal to interact with your project.\n",
    "    - You can also use the Command Palette to access Cline commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Common Cline Commands**:\n",
    "    - `cline init`: Initialize a new Cline project.\n",
    "    - `cline build`: Build the project.\n",
    "    - `cline run`: Run the project.\n",
    "    - `cline test`: Run tests for the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Debugging with Cline**:\n",
    "    - Set breakpoints in your code.\n",
    "    - Use the Debug view in VS Code to start a debugging session.\n",
    "    - Use Cline commands to control the debugging process.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Additional Resources**:\n",
    "    - Refer to the Cline documentation for more detailed information and advanced usage.\n",
    "    - Explore the VS Code documentation for tips on maximizing your productivity with the editor.\n",
    "\n",
    "This roadmap should help you get started with using Cline on VS Code."

    "Claude Sonnet (is like Copilot)\n",
    "\n",
    "    What it is: Claude Sonnet is a model developed by Anthropic, part of the Claude 3 family. It is designed for general-purpose tasks, including coding, and is known for its efficiency, speed, and high-quality responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Use Case: It excels at implementation tasks like writing code, debugging, and iterating on solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Integration: Claude Sonnet is often used in popular AI coding tools like Cursor, v0, Bolt, and VSCode Copilot as the default model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cline Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "    What it is: Cline is a VS Code extension that acts as a bridge between your editor and various AI models, including Claude Sonnet, OpenAI, DeepSeek, and others.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Use Case: Cline allows you to configure and switch between different AI models (like DeepSeek R1 and Claude Sonnet) depending on your needs. For example, you can use DeepSeek R1 for planning and Claude Sonnet for implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Integration: Cline supports multiple API providers, including OpenRouter, Anthropic (Claude), OpenAI, Google Gemini, and local models like Ollama or LM Studio.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Flexibility: Cline is not tied to a specific model—it’s a tool that lets you use the best model for the task at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "How Cline works with DeepSeek and Claude\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're using Cline in VS Code, you can configure it to use Claude Sonnet for coding tasks and DeepSeek R1 for planning or reasoning tasks. This combination allows you to leverage the strengths of both models while optimizing cost and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Use DeepSeek R1 (via Cline) for planning, understanding complex tasks, or breaking down problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Switch to Claude Sonnet (via Cline) for writing, debugging, and iterating on code."
